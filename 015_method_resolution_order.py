# Method Resolution Order is the order in which classes are searched for methods and attributes in python's inheritance hierarchy. In multiple inheritance scenarios where a class inherits from multiple super classes, MRO determines the order in which the classes are searched for methods and attributes. Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to compute the MRO, which ensures a consistent and predictable order of method resolution.
# The MRO can be accessed using the `__mro__` attribute of a class or the `mro()` method. The MRO is important for understanding how method calls are resolved in complex inheritance hierarchies, and it can help avoid issues such as the diamond problem, where a method could be inherited from multiple classes in a way that creates ambiguity.
# Example:
class A:
    def method(self):
        return "Method from A"


class B(A):
    def method(self):
        return "Method from B"


class C(A):
    def method(self):
        return "Method from C"


class D(B, C):
    def method(self):
        return "Method from D"


print(D().method())  # Output: Method from D
print(
    D.__mro__
)  # Output: (<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>)
# In this example, the method resolution order is D -> B -> C -> A, which is determined by the order in which the classes are defined and their inheritance relationships. The MRO ensures that when `D().method()` is called, it resolves to the method defined in class D, followed by B, C, and finally A if needed.
# This concept is crucial for understanding how Python handles method resolution in complex class hierarchies, especially when dealing with multiple inheritance. It allows developers to predict how methods will be resolved and helps maintain a clear and consistent structure in their code.

# How the c3 linearization algorithm works:
# The c3 linearization algorithm takes the class hierarchy as input and computes a linearization of the classes in a way that satisfies the following conditions:
# 1. Each class appears only once in the linearization.
# 2. The linearization is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each class is a node and the edges represent the parent-child relationships.
# 3. The linearization is a linear order of the classes such that for each class C, all its parent classes appear before C in the linearization.
# 4. The linearization is a linear order of the classes such that for each class C, all its children classes appear after C in the linearization.
# The c3 linearization algorithm is used by Python to compute the MRO. It follows a depth-first search (DFS) approach to visit the parent classes of each class in a topological order, ensuring that all parent classes have been visited before the current class.


# Depth first search (DFS) algorithm:
def dfs(graph, start, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    visited.add(start)
    for neighbor in graph[start]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)
    return visited


# Example usage of DFS algorithm:
graph = {
    "A": ["B", "C"],
    "B": ["D"],
}

print(dfs(graph, "A"))
# Output: {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D'}
# The DFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It is used to visit all the nodes in a graph or tree data structure, and it can be implemented using recursion or an explicit stack.
# The DFS algorithm can be used to compute the MRO of a class hierarchy by visiting each class and its parent classes in a depth-first manner, ensuring that all parent classes are visited before the current class. This allows for a consistent and predictable order of method resolution in complex inheritance hierarchies.
# The DFS algorithm is a fundamental algorithm in computer science and is widely used in various applications, including graph traversal, pathfinding, and topological sorting. It is a powerful tool for exploring and analyzing complex data structures, and it can be used to solve a wide range of problems in computer science and software development.

        for lst in lists:
            if lst:
                merged.append(lst.pop(0))
                break
        else:
            break

# Example usage of merge order lists:

print(merge_order_lists(lists))

# Output: [1, 4, 6, 2, 5, 7, 3, 8]
# The merge order lists function takes a list of lists as input and merges them into a single list in a specific order. It iterates through each list and appends the first element of each list to the merged list, ensuring that the elements are added in the order they appear in the input lists. This function can be used to merge multiple lists into a single list while preserving the order of elements.
# The merge order lists function can be used in various applications, such as merging multiple sorted lists, combining data from different sources, or merging multiple streams of data into a single stream. It is a simple yet powerful function that can be used to manipulate and process lists in Python.
# The merge order lists function can be used in conjunction with the DFS algorithm to compute the MRO of a class hierarchy. By merging the lists of parent classes in the order they are visited, we can create a linearization of the classes that satisfies the conditions of the MRO. This allows us to compute the MRO in a consistent and predictable manner, ensuring that all parent classes are visited before the current class and that all children classes appear after the current class in the linearization.
# The merge order lists function can also be used to combine multiple streams of data into a single stream, allowing for efficient processing and analysis of large datasets. It is a versatile function that can be used in a wide range of applications, from data processing to algorithm design.
