# classes and objects are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). They allow us to create custom data structures and define their behavior. They allow you model real-world entities as objects with attributes(data) and methods(behavior).

# A class is a blueprint/template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have. An object is an instance of a class, meaning it is created based on the class definition.
