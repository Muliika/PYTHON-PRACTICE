# Writing idiomatic python code involves following best practices and conventions
# that make the code more readable, maintainable, and efficient. Here are some examples:
# Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code:
# Adhere to guidelines outlined in PEP 8, such as using 4 spaces per indentation level, and using docstrings for function definitions.
# Use list comprehensions:
# Instead of using loops to create lists, use list comprehensions for more concise and readable code.
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
# Avoid explicit indexing:
# Instead of using explicit indexing to iterate over a list, use the enumerate function.
for index, value in enumerate(["a", "b", "c"]):
    print(index, value)
# Use python's built-in functions and data types:
# Instead of implementing your own sorting algorithm, use the built-in sorted function.
sorted_list = sorted(my_list)
# Use context managers:
# Use the with statement to handle file operations, which automatically takes care of closing the file.
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
# Leverage generator expressions:
# Use generator expressions for large datasets to save memory.

# Be pythonic but not too clever:
# Strive for clarity and simplicity in your code, avoiding overly complex or clever solutions that may be difficult for others to understand.
